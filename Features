What sets my site apart:
right now my site is in the priliminary stages of developement which has been put up to show the fact that if givena chance that i along with our honourable MUN technical team lead and all the chosen members can easily within a small time frame create an astoundingly flabbeergasting site for the club
also the information in my site is all handtyped to showcase that i am affluent in the usage of english axioms and its diction so ican conve a heap of phrases,idioms,rhetorics,and jargons which will make the site more appealing without the tech team having to consult other teams.
