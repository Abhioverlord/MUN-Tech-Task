What sets my site apart:
right now my site is in the preliminary stages of development which has been put up to show the fact that if given a chance.
I, along with our honourable MUN technical team lead and all the chosen members can easily within a small time frame create an astoundingly flabbergasting site 
for the club.
Additionally, the information provided on my site is all hand-typed to showcase that I am affluent in the usage of English axioms and their diction.
This proves I can convey a heap of phrases, idioms, rhetorics, and terminologies. 
Resulting in providing myself as a direct approach to the team itself to aid the efficiency of our content further.
