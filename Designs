Designing for Uniqueness
The unique part of my code is perhaps its flexibilty and the fact that t is in its most basic form while also conveying the message of me being an average coder with a huge hunger for learning and developing into a better self.
i have also included a google form of feedback to better understand my shortcomings to improve in the future.
