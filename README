A Brief Explanation

a small explanation to be given is that the code written is a very basic form of itself giving an outline to my knowledge in html and css,
As i supposed that no external help was allowed i was unable to mix and match different colours with each other,
like i can code any two available colours both by names and bg color code but i am not very good when it comes to telling whether red looks better with black or blue .

also a few pictures of famous freedom fighters have been put in a specific arrangement which can be easily modified to be below the text and using css a bit more intensively can be modified so as to the text is beside the image or the text is between two images.
<br> to leave a line <strong>,<i> , many other functions have been used to dispaly the basic knowledge about the language inputs which are used to make the design appealing.
